# Express CI Pipeline

This project demonstrates a continuous integration pipeline for an Express.js application.

## Project Overview

This is a basic Express.js application with a CI/CD pipeline set up. It's designed to showcase how to implement automated testing and deployment for a Node.js web application.

## Features

- Express.js web server
- Automated testing with Jest
- CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins (or your specific CI tool)
- Dockerized application for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Docker (for containerization)
- Jenkins (or your specific CI tool)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Piipip/express-ci-pipeline.git
   cd express-ci-pipeline
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

To run the automated tests:

```
npm test
```

## Docker

To build and run the Docker container:

1. Build the image:
   ```
   docker build -t express-ci-pipeline .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 express-ci-pipeline
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a Jenkins pipeline (or your specific CI tool) configuration. The pipeline typically includes the following stages:

1. Checkout
2. Install Dependencies
3. Run Tests
4. Build Docker Image
5. Deploy (if applicable)

Refer to the `Jenkinsfile` (or your specific pipeline configuration file) for more details.

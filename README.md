# ExpressCI: Streamlining Node.js Deployment
This project demonstrates a continuous integration pipeline for an Express.js application.

## Project Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an Express.js application. The initial setup includes creating an Express.js app using Express Generator, setting up Git for version control, and pushing the initial code to GitHub.

## Introduction

This is a basic Express.js application with a CI/CD pipeline set up. It's designed to showcase how to implement automated testing and deployment for a Node.js web application.

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose of the CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates the workflow from code commit to deployment, ensuring a smooth and reliable delivery pipeline.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express.js
- Jenkins for CI/CD orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub for version control and webhooks

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Ensure your system meets the following requirements to run the application smoothly.

### Required Software and Tools

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Docker (for containerization)
- Jenkins (or your specific CI tool)

## Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up the project environment.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository using the command provided in the installation instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piipip/express-ci-pipeline.git
cd express-ci-pipeline
```

### Installing Dependencies
Ensure all necessary packages are installed by running:

```bash
npm install
```
### Configuring Environment Variables
If your application requires specific environment variables, make sure to set them in a .env file or configure them in your environment.

### Running the Application
#### Starting the Development Server
To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

#### Testing the Application Locally
To ensure the application is functioning correctly, run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Overview of the CI/CD Process
The CI/CD process involves automating the workflow from code commit to deployment, ensuring a smooth and reliable delivery pipeline.

### Configuration of Jenkins
Set up Jenkins on your server or local machine.
Create a new pipeline job and link it to your GitHub repository.
Configure the Jenkins pipeline with the necessary steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.

### Docker Setup
Create a Dockerfile to define the container image for your application.
Use Docker Compose (if necessary) to manage multi-container setups.

### Automated Testing
Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes do not introduce errors.

### Deployment Process
Configure deployment steps within the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the application to your hosting environment upon successful builds.

## Testing

### Running Tests Locally
You can run the tests locally to ensure everything is functioning as expected:

```bash
npm test
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Testing

After setting up the CI/CD pipeline, monitor the Jenkins console output to verify that each stage runs successfully.

## Usage
### How to Access the Application
Once the application is running, access it via your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
Document any API endpoints your application exposes, including request and response formats.
